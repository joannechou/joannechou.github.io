  <h3>REDEFINE CORPORATE YOGA</h3>
  <p>ADRASANA has the ambition to become the premium corporate yoga experience brand, offering an incomparable office yoga service quality associated with a state of mind that you can not find anywhere else.</p>
  <p>Brands like FAANG are not just improving the corporate wellness experience; they are redefining it. ADRASANA has learned from them just what it takes to design and deliver office wellness experiences that make employees‚Äô lives easier and work more enjoyable. After all, the benefits of a better employee experience are undeniable. Jacob Morgan, author of The Employee Experience Advantage, found in his research that companies investing in corporate wellness have four-times the average profit and two-times the average revenue.</p>
  <h3>Invest in the good stuff</h3>
  <p>We provide the highest-quality custom yoga mats, for rent or for purchase. The mats are slightly longer and wider than traditional yoga mats. Made from matte eco-friendly natural rubber, the yoga mats are very grippy, non-slip, and dry wicking‚Äîthese mats are magic.

  <h3>Bring your team together, one yoga class at a time</h3>
  <p>Every group is different. It can be hard to know if the class you are booking is right for your employees. We handle this for you by personalizing classes based on the feedback employees provide in short post-class email surveys. We adjust difficulty and preferences based on what employees need. For large offices, we can run multiple classes for different time preferences and skill levels.</p>
  <p>Employee behaviors and expectations are constantly changing, so it is crucial to keep a constant pulse on the community and refine your corporate wellness program based on insightful input. We rely on customer feedback and behavioral data to continually improve the class. Employees submit feedback for their classes so every class is better than the last! Ongoing surveys and feedback tools paint a detailed picture of how the employee experience is perceived‚Äîand how it can be improved. Future classes will be tailored based on collective and ongoing feedback. Ready to run your wellness program flawlessly?</p>

  <h3>Spend less time planning corporate on-site experiences and more time connecting over yoga.</h3>
  <p>Cultural transformation takes time. Historically, HR has been the primary advocate for an organization‚Äôs employees. But in today‚Äôs digitally-driven startup culture, HR can not do it alone. They have to work closely with workplace wellness experts, adopting a transformative mindset that supports employee-centric experiences. ADRASANA is notoriously employee-obsessed, using personalization tactics to make the corporate wellness experience seamless for the office.</p>
  <p>ADRASANA supports HR in their day-to-day work needs. We take on the burden of logistics. After the initial class, we find which time(s) are best for office wellness yoga. We send calendar invites every week with detailed information about the instructor. We track attendance and measure happiness so you have total visibility into what is working. We will make proactive suggestions based on what employees need. As a fully distributed yoga studio, all of our instructors are quality certified from renowned 500-hr E-RYT institutions around the world with at least 10 years of teaching experience. Each instructor carries liability insurance.</p>
  <p>Employee burnout is an official medical diagnosis. We transform an office culture that reflects the modern day workplace while boosting morale, reducing stress, and improving health.</p>
